# Rules for crafting th bibliography

It is important that we update our bibliography in real time, so we don't get backlogged towards our deadline. 

Everytime you find a new source that contributes to the research, or helps your understanding, add it to the bibliography with the following format:

## Format

**TY:** Type (indicates the type of reference; here, "JOUR" means itâ€™s a journal article)

**JOUR:** Journal

**DOI:** Digital Object Identifier (a unique identifier for the document)

**UR:** Uniform Resource Locator (the URL where the document can be accessed)

**TI:** Title (the title of the paper)

**T2:** Secondary Title (often used for the name of the conference series or journal)

**AU:** Author

**PY:** Publication Year

**DA:** Date (often indicating the publication date)

**PB:** Publisher

**SP:** Starting Page (the page on which the article begins)

**IS:** Issue (the issue number of the journal)

**VL:** Volume (the volume number of the journal)

**SN:** Serial Number (commonly the ISSN for journals)

**AB:** Abstract (A brief summary of the paper. How did it contribute to our research or understanding? Reference any specific data or writing you used.)
