# Research Tools

As we do research we may start a very high level to focus our understand. A good place to start is often google searches, AI, or tertiary articles like wikipedia. However, as you get deeper and more specific into your reasearch, you will be looking for primary and secondary sources. Google schollar can be helpful, but you need to be aware the the results of any search are manipulated by google. Many papers fro google scholar will also be behind a paywall. UTD provides us access to several databases that they have paid for. You can search for specific keywords, authors, and journals. You can also search for papers that have cited a specific paper. This is a great way to find more recent papers that have built ont the work of the paper. You can make generalizations on the legitmacy of the paper based upon the number of citations.
